# Executive Summary: NeuroRegen Project
## Mechanizmy Regeneracji Tkanek Nerwowych u Modelowych Organizmów

**Project ID:** NSF-BIO-2024-7821
**Duration:** 48 months (January 2024 - December 2027)
**Total Budget:** $2,400,000
**Institution:** University of California, San Diego - Department of Developmental Biology

---

## Problem Statement

Human central nervous system (CNS) has severely limited regenerative capacity following traumatic injury or stroke. Approximately 17,000 new spinal cord injury cases occur annually in the US alone, with lifetime costs exceeding $5 million per patient. In stark contrast, certain vertebrate species such as zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) and axolotls (*Ambystoma mexicanum*) demonstrate remarkable CNS regeneration, fully restoring complex neural circuits within 3-4 weeks post-injury.

**Critical Knowledge Gap:** We do not understand the molecular mechanisms that distinguish regeneration-competent versus regeneration-incompetent vertebrate neural tissue. Identifying these master regulatory programs could unlock therapeutic targets for human CNS injury.

---

## Proposed Solution

**Approach:** Comparative transcriptomics combined with functional genomics to identify and validate regeneration master regulators.

**Strategy:**
1. **Discovery Phase:** Perform time-resolved RNA-sequencing of injured neural tissue in zebrafish (regenerating) vs. mouse (non-regenerating) to identify differentially expressed gene programs
2. **Validation Phase:** Use CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screening in zebrafish to functionally validate candidate regeneration genes
3. **Translation Phase:** Test ectopic expression of top candidates in mouse CNS injury model to assess gain-of-regenerative capacity

**Innovation:**
- Cross-species comparative approach leverages evolutionary divergence
- Integrates cutting-edge single-cell RNA-seq to resolve cell-type-specific programs
- Uses AAV-mediated gene delivery for proof-of-concept mammalian studies

---

## Research Objectives

**Primary Objectives:**

1. **Identify regeneration-associated gene programs** through comparative RNA-seq analysis (bulk + single-cell) of zebrafish vs. mouse spinal cord injury models at 6 timepoints (0h, 6h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d post-injury)

2. **Functionally validate 15-20 candidate genes** using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in zebrafish, measuring impact on regeneration outcomes (axon regrowth, functional recovery)

3. **Test regenerative capacity** of top 3 candidate genes through AAV-mediated expression in mouse spinal cord injury model

**Secondary Objectives:**

4. Generate comprehensive single-cell atlas of regenerating zebrafish spinal cord (target: 50,000 cells across timepoints)

5. Establish open-access data repository and analysis portal for comparative regeneration research community
